## Trade-off between Nature Accuracy and Adversarial Robustness

Deep neural networks (DNNs) can achieve excellent performance on various complex tasks. However, recent studies have found that deep neural networks face serious security risks, namely adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks refer to adding subtle perturbations to input data that are imperceptible to humans, causing deep neural networks to produce wrong outputs. Current research often faces difficulties in the Trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness, as well as the Trade-off between overall robustness and worst robustness (fairness issues), which poses challenges for DNNs in practical applications. Therefore, finding effective methods to address those difficult trade-off phenomena, is an urgent and challenging issue in deep learning.

This direction aims to address the challenge of balancing the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. The specific research content includes the following three aspects: Aiming at mitigating the Trade-off from network architecture, (1) a robust neural network architecture design based on a dynamic routing mechanism is proposed: Based on dynamic neural network architecture, the design of an inference model sensitive to input data, adaptively select the optimal network inference path and weight parameters for inference. Aiming at mitigating the Trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness, (2) an adversarial training method for multi-teacher network collaborative knowledge distillation is proposed: For dynamic neural network architecture, adopt teacher models with strong adversarial robustness and accuracy, responsible for weight training of adversarial examples and clean examples, respectively. Aiming at enhancing robust fairness, (3) an adversarial robustness distillation method based on anti-bias soft labels is proposed: Hard and easy classes are guided by teacher labels with different smoothness degrees, which are controlled by temperatures.


## Viewpoint Robustness and Invariance of Vision Models

Obtaining robust and invariant representations has been a longstanding challenge in the field of computer vision. Previous deep learning research on robustness has largely concentrated on adversarial perturbations under the L-p norm. However, in complex and dynamic physical environments, there exist many natural perturbations worthy of investigation, among which 3D viewpoint transformations are a particularly important factor. Studying model robustness under natural viewpoint changes holds significant relevance for safety-critical applications in areas such as autonomous driving and embodied robotics.

This direction focuses on investigating the robustness and invariance of existing deep learning-based vision models in the face of viewpoint transformations. It currently consists of four components: (1) Viewpoint robustness evaluation methods, which utilizes multi-view 3D reconstruction approaches such as neural radiance fields to capture the modelâ€™s worst-case viewpoint distribution. (2) An extreme/adversarial viewpoint sample generation method for producing realistic adversarial viewpoint examples. (3) A viewpoint-invariant adversarial training (VIAT) approach designed to enhance the viewpoint invariance of traditional single-task visual models via adversarial distribution training. (4) A viewpoint-invariant fine-tuning method for vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models. By performing cross-viewpoint alignment on a large-scale multi-view image-text dataset, we enhance the viewpoint-invariant representation capability of VLP models.
